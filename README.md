# Anti-Deceit-Vocal-App
*An android app to help fight crime against illiterates.*

A considerable portion of our society has very low literacy rates. People not only struggle to write their names on paper but are also unable to read documents of relevance.
This often leaves them vulnerable to scams and dependent on others who take advantage of their inability to read.
On the other hand, the literate population finds it difficult to communicate effectively while travelling to foreign places.
Our project is aimed at building a platform which can help any individual with minimal knowledge about a particular language understand what's written. 
It is an easy to use solution which has been specially designed with the layman in mind.
The user only needs to click a photograph of the writing and the content will automatically be narrated in the userâ€™s native language.

Steps to use the software:
1. Install Android Studio.
2. Clone the repository or download the zip file.
3. Add the java files under app directory.
4. Add the xml files for the layout of the app under the res directory.
5. Add the AndroidManifest file.
6. Build the app using gradle.
7. Connect the phone and install the app on the phone.
8. Run the vocal app and begin converting text :)
